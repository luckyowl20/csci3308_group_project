  to create a new section using the section helper
  define the section in the page/partial you want as 

  {#section "(section name)""} 
    <script></script>
  {/script}
  reference it to be included as a part of a layout using:
  _sections.(section name)       
--}}

{{{ _sections.scripts }}} 
{{! --
  this specifically includes scripts at the END of the page for 
  1. improved page perfomance
  2. avoiding render blocking where the template can block the browser from rendering until all scripts are downloaded
  3. seperation of concerns: allows the template to remain concise and scripts become easier to manage for each page
