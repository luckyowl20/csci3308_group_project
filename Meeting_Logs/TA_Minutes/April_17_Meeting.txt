Daniel: Work on restaurant stuff more (maybe make swipe) Restaurants/Cusines -> Matches
Vanum: Make it(?) more related to friends (the blog I think it was reffering to)
        Make it more clear that the feed page is a feed page
Matt: Integration & Testing
Alec: Restrict access to other users profile page memories - 7 photos (?), presentation
Nina: Link song likes (maybe dislikes) to database. Front end ui to be more consistant. Songs/Genres -> Matches
John: ?
Vivian: Link matching algorithm to display in swipe. Categorize matches & friends
        Integration!!!

Presenting: Real live demo, must show that we are not dummy data it
Slides: fine to use edited pictures

Matches and friends have to be segregated

Confused about matches/friends

*** VERY IMPORTANT ***
- When swiping, can click on profile to see more pictures, Open profile to 7 pictures
    Or just see 7 images in carosel
- Integrating with Algorithm

Styling:        (Matt, Vivian, Alec)
